- Created by: mod-at-nwa
- Creation date: March 2025

## Introduction

In Suno’s Custom Mode, the **STYLE** and **LYRICS** fields allow you to shape professional, cohesive songs. This guide offers advanced strategies for leveraging these fields with precision, focusing on lyrical flow, structural clarity, and creative experimentation.

---

## The STYLE Field: Defining Genre and Mood

The **STYLE** field establishes your song’s genre, mood, and sonic character. Use concise, vivid descriptors to guide the AI effectively.

- **Be Specific and Concise**: Opt for clear genre terms like "gritty blues rock."
- **Blend Genres Thoughtfully**: Pair complementary styles, e.g., "dreamy synth pop."
- **Add Mood and Instrumentation**: Enhance with terms like "somber" or "piano-driven."
- **Explore Niche Styles**: Experiment with unique mixes like "retro cyberpunk."

**Examples**:
- "Upbeat funk pop, soulful"
- "Ethereal darkwave, glitchy synths"
- "Tender acoustic ballad, strings"

**Tip**: Limit to 2-4 key terms to maintain clarity.

## The LYRICS Field: Structuring with Meta Tags and Perfecting Cadence

The **LYRICS** field is where you input your song’s words and use meta tags to define its structure and dynamics.

### Using Meta Tags Effectively

Meta tags, enclosed in square brackets `[ ]`, organize your song and signal musical or vocal shifts. Examples include `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`, and `[Outro]`, as well as dynamic tags like `[Guitar Solo]` or `[Beat Drop]`.

- **[Tags] with Parentheses**: Use parentheses within tags for clarification or additional instructions. For example:
  ```
  [Chorus (808, synth pads)]
  ```
  This instructs the AI to include 808 drums and synth pads in the chorus.
  ```
  [Breakdown (drum fill in)]
  ```
  Here, a drum fill is specified for the breakdown.

- **Parentheses in Lyrics**: Outside of tags, parentheses indicate background vocals. For example:
  ```
  I want to tell you (tell you)
  Something good
  ```
  The `(tell you)` is sung by background vocalists, echoing the main line.

**Full Example**:
```
[Verse]
Shadows fall across the floor,
Whispers echo, I want more.
[Chorus (Catchy Hook, 808)]
Rise up now (rise up),
We’re breaking free,
This is where we’re meant to be.
```

**Tip**: Place tags at the start of each section and align them with the lyrics’ intent for seamless integration.

### Crafting Lyrics with Natural Cadence

Natural cadence ensures your lyrics flow effortlessly with the melody.

- **Control Syllable Count**: Keep lines concise and rhythmic.
- **Use Punctuation**: Commas, dashes, or periods guide pacing.
- **Test Aloud**: Sing or read lyrics to confirm flow.
- **Keep Verses Short**: Short verses hold attention; occasionally try ultra-short verses for impact. For example:
  ```
  Shadows fall,
  Whispers call.
  ```
- **Use Vowels for Improvisation**: Words with extended vowels (e.g., "ooooooooh") allow singers to trill or improvise. For example:
  ```
  Like this, oooooooooh yeah.
  ```
  The prolonged "o" offers vocal flexibility.

**Example of Good Cadence**:
```
[Verse]
City lights burn through the haze,
Lost in dreams of better days.
```

**Example of Poor Cadence**:
```
[Verse]
Illuminations of the urban environment pierce through atmospheric obscurity,
I find myself ensnared in reveries concerning superior temporal periods.
```

**Tip**: Favor contractions and simple phrasing for smoother delivery.

### Ensuring Cohesion Between Lyrics and Tags

Lyrics and tags must complement each other and the **STYLE**.

- **Thematic Consistency**: Pair hopeful lyrics with "uplifting pop" or dark themes with "gritty industrial."
- **Tag-Relevant Lyrics**: Write bold, anthemic lines for `[Chorus]` or introspective ones for `[Bridge]`.

**Example**:
```
STYLE: "Aggressive punk rock"
[Chorus (Shouted)]
Tear it down, we won’t obey,
Chaos reigns, we’re here to stay!
```

## Advanced Techniques for LYRICS and STYLE

Elevate your songs with these creative methods:

- **Layering Tags**: Combine tags for complex shifts, e.g., `[Verse (Heavy drums)]`.
- **Controlling Vocal Delivery**: Specify styles like `[Rap]` or `[Soft Female Vocal]`.
- **Adding Silence**: Insert `[Pause]` or `[Instrumental Break]` for dramatic effect.
- **Scat Styled Breakdowns**: Use rhythmic, non-sensical "scat" lyrics in `[Hook]` or `[Breakdown]` for a playful or hypnotic vibe. For example:
  ```
  [hook - 808 lead, synth crescendo]
  bip bip
  bip bop
  bip bip bip...
  bip bip bip...
  oooooo aaaaa ohhh yeaaahhh
  Losing my mind
  Holding my pride
  ```
  The "bip bip" pattern adds rhythm, while vowels extend the melody.

**Tip**: Apply experimental techniques sparingly to preserve the song’s clarity and purpose.

## Advanced Lyrical Rhythmic Expression and Planning

In songwriting, **advanced lyrical rhythmic expression** transforms lyrics into a rhythmic force that complements and enhances the music’s groove. This technique focuses on the timing, syllabic structure, and delivery of words to create a percussive effect, making the lyrics an active part of the song’s beat. By planning syllables and strategically breaking rhythmic patterns, you can elevate the energy and musicality of your work. This section breaks down these concepts and provides practical guidance, drawing from the provided lyrics about a casual encounter gone awry.

### Understanding Rhythmic Expression

Advanced lyrical rhythmic expression involves three core elements:
- **Syllabic Planning**: Selecting words and phrases that align with the song’s beat, ensuring a seamless flow.
- **Percussive Delivery**: Using the timing of syllables to mimic or enhance the percussion, adding a layer of rhythm.
- **Structural Breaks**: Introducing moments where the established rhythm shifts or subdivides, filling spaces with patterned expressions for dynamic impact.

These techniques are evident in the provided lyrics, where repetition, conversational phrasing, and rhythmic hooks drive the song’s groove.

### Key Techniques for Rhythmic Mastery

#### 1. Syllabic Planning for Flow

To make lyrics rhythmically compelling:
- **Align Syllables with Beats**: Match the syllable count to the song’s time signature (e.g., four syllables per bar in 4/4 time).
- **Repeat for Emphasis**: Use repetition to reinforce rhythmic patterns.
- **Keep It Punchy**: Favor short, rhythmic phrases to maintain momentum.

**Example with Instructions**:
```
[Verse]
I got a message, she said (she said)  // 8 syllables, fits a 4/4 bar
"What you doin', big head?"         // 6 syllables, slightly syncopated
```
*Instruction*: Count syllables to match the beat. Here, "she said" in parentheses adds a background echo, enhancing the rhythm without overloading the bar.

#### 2. Breaking Structure for Percussive Impact

A key moment in rhythmic expression is **"The Moment"**—where the main structure breaks, and spaces are filled with subdivided or varied syllabic patterns. This adds a percussive punch and keeps the listener engaged.

**Example with Instructions**:
```
[Breakdown]
Help me find my drawls (help me find my drawls)  // Main rhythmic hook
[Pause]                                          // Brief silence builds tension
Yeah-yeah, some-body help me please             // Faster subdivision fills the space
```
*Instruction*: After repeating the hook, insert a `[Pause]` to break the flow, then follow with a quicker, subdivided phrase like "Yeah-yeah, some-body" to reintroduce rhythm dynamically.

#### 3. Enhancing with Vocal Techniques

- **Background Vocals**: Use parentheses to add echoes or responses, deepening the rhythmic texture.
- **Repetition as a Hook**: Repeat catchy phrases to anchor the rhythm.
- **Pauses for Drama**: Insert `[Pause]` or `[Instrumental Break]` to create tension and release.

**Example with Instructions**:
```
[Chorus]
Help me find my drawls (help me find my drawls)  // 6 syllables, steady beat
I got somewhere to be                            // 6 syllables, maintains flow
(Help me, please)                                // Echo adds rhythmic layer
```
*Instruction*: Repeat the main line for catchiness, and use "(Help me, please)" as a background vocal to overlap and enrich the rhythm.

### Applying Meta Tags to Structure Rhythm

Use meta tags to organize and signal rhythmic shifts:
- **`[Intro]`**: Establish the groove with a simple, rhythmic opening.
- **`[Verse]`**: Build the story with steady, beat-aligned phrasing.
- **`[Chorus]`**: Deliver a memorable, repetitive hook that drives the rhythm.

**Full Example with Instructions**:
```
[Intro]
Early Thursday morning, oh yeah          // 7 syllables, sets a relaxed groove
[Verse]
I was on my way to the crib (to the crib)  // 8 syllables with echo
I got a message, she said                   // 7 syllables, conversational
"What you doin', big head?"                 // 6 syllables, punchy
[Chorus]
Help me find my drawls (help me find my drawls)  // 6 + echo, rhythmic anchor
I got somewhere to be                            // 6 syllables, steady
(Help me, please)                                // Background layer
```
*Instruction*: Start with an `[Intro]` to set the tone, use `[Verse]` for storytelling with rhythmic echoes, and make the `[Chorus]` a repetitive, beat-driven hook.

### Analyzing the Provided Lyrics

The lyrics provided showcase rhythmic expression effectively:
- **Repetition**: "Help me find my drawls" repeats as a rhythmic hook, reinforced by background vocals in parentheses.
- **Conversational Cadence**: Lines like "I got a message, she said 'What you doin', big head?'" mimic natural speech, aligning with the beat.
- **Structural Break**: The shift to searching ("I looked on the floor, oh, and I looked on the stairs") introduces a slight rhythmic variation, adding urgency.

### Practical Tips for Songwriters

- **Map the Beat**: Before writing, tap out the song’s rhythm and fit syllables to it.
- **Test Aloud**: Sing or rap your lyrics to ensure they groove with the music.
- **Vary Repetition**: Repeat hooks but tweak phrasing or add echoes to avoid monotony.
- **Use Silence**: A `[Pause]` before a hook can heighten its impact.
- **Balance Story and Rhythm**: Ensure the narrative (e.g., losing drawls) remains clear amid rhythmic focus.

## Advanced Song Structure Template

When crafting songs in Suno’s Custom Mode, a well-defined structure is key to creating a professional, engaging track. Below is a versatile song format that balances repetition and progression, perfectly tailored to Suno’s capabilities:

**Song Format**:  
- Intro  
- Verse 1  
- Pre-chorus  
- Verse 2  
- Pre-chorus  
- Chorus  
- Verse 3  
- Pre-chorus  
- Bridge  
- Verse 4  
- Pre-chorus  
- Chorus  
- Outro  

### Why This Works  
This structure provides a clear roadmap for your song:  
- **Intro**: Sets the tone and hooks the listener.  
- **Verses**: Deliver the story or theme with evolving lyrics.  
- **Pre-chorus**: Builds anticipation for the chorus.  
- **Chorus**: The emotional peak, memorable and repeatable.  
- **Bridge**: Adds contrast and depth, breaking the pattern.  
- **Outro**: Ties it all together for a satisfying close.  

The repetition of the pre-chorus keeps the song cohesive, while the bridge and varied verses prevent monotony. It’s a direct hack for Suno’s Custom Mode, ensuring your song feels dynamic yet polished.

### Example: "Tmux Song"  
Here’s how this format could be applied to a song about the terminal tool tmux:  

- **Intro**: Instrumental, a rhythmic beep-like synth to mimic typing.  
- **Verse 1**: "Split the screen, I’m in control / Windows stack, I’m on a roll."  
- **Pre-chorus**: "Fingers fly, the panes align / Terminal’s mine, it’s by design."  
- **Verse 2**: "Sessions saved, I never quit / Detach and roam, bit by bit."  
- **Pre-chorus**: "Fingers fly, the panes align / Terminal’s mine, it’s by design."  
- **Chorus**: "Tmux, oh tmux, you set me free / Multitask magic, just for me."  
- **Verse 3**: "Prefix keys, I’m in the zone / Commands flow, I’m not alone."  
- **Pre-chorus**: "Fingers fly, the panes align / Terminal’s mine, it’s by design."  
- **Bridge**: "No more chaos, no more fuss / Power shifts with every plus."  
- **Verse 4**: "Reattach, I’m back in play / Tmux reigns, I’m here to stay."  
- **Pre-chorus**: "Fingers fly, the panes align / Terminal’s mine, it’s by design."  
- **Chorus**: "Tmux, oh tmux, you set me free / Multitask magic, just for me."  
- **Outro**: Slow fade of the synth, echoing the chorus melody.  

This example shows how the structure keeps the song engaging while fitting Suno’s framework. Try plugging your own lyrics into this template to see it shine!

### Conclusion

Advanced lyrical rhythmic expression turns words into a rhythmic instrument. By planning syllables, breaking structures strategically, and layering vocals, you can craft lyrics that pulse with the music. Use meta tags like `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, and `[Chorus]` to guide the AI, and test your work aloud to perfect the flow. With these techniques, your songs—like the playful hunt for lost drawls—will resonate with both rhythm and soul.
